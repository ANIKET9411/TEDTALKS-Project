    <h1>Conferences</h1>
    <h3>Every year, TED hosts conferences to bring together a group of expert thinkers and doers across a wide range of fields to help share new ideas. We’re joined by prominent academics, educators, researchers, philanthropists, environmentalists, scientists, technologists, artists, activists and more. If you’d like to come to a conference, you’ll need to apply to attend. We read every application, and actively seek out new members.</h3><br>

<h2>Initiatives funded by a TED Conference membership</h2>
<p><b>The mighty TEDx community:</b> TEDx events cause ripples of change around the world. Last year, there were more than 3,600 TEDx events in places like Tehran, Beijing and Reykjavik. Costs of this program include ongoing training and seminars for hosts, and outreach to new communities, among other ambitious goals to support this passionate global community.</p>
<a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">Learn more about TED-ED</a><br>
<p><b>TED-Ed:</b> Our award-winning series of free animated educational videos -- and much more, including a free teacher training program and the rapidly expanding TED-Ed Clubs movement, spreading critical-thinking skills in classrooms around the world for free.</p>

<p>
    <b>The Audacious Project:</b> A new model to support big ideas for global change, each year The Audacious Project invites change agents to dream big, selects their most ambitious ideas and presents them at the annual TED Conference, asking donors and supporters to come together to launch them. With its inaugural class, TED raised more than $400 million to make them a reality. </p>

    <p>
       <b> TED Translators:</b> TED videos -- TED Talks, TEDx talks, TED-Ed lessons and more -- are subtitled in more than 100 languages, thanks to generous volunteer translators supported by a small team. Going forward, we will reach out to more language communities, constantly improve our software tools and training, and make talks accessible to ever more people.</p>

       <p>
       <b> Free TED Talks online:</b> Producing, editing and online distribution of our daily TED Talk costs money -- and in the coming year, we have ambitious plans to share even more talks per day, in multiple languages, and to build more tools to help you connect with the next TED Talk that might change your life.</p>
